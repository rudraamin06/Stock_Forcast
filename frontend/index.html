<!--
  Stock Forecast Application - Main HTML Entry Point
  =================================================
  
  This HTML file serves as the entry point for the React application.
  It provides the basic HTML structure and loads the JavaScript bundle
  that contains the React application.
  
  Key Elements:
  - HTML5 doctype declaration
  - Meta tags for proper rendering and character encoding
  - Viewport meta tag for responsive design
  - Root div element where React mounts the application
  - Script tag that loads the main TypeScript entry point
  
  The application is a Single Page Application (SPA) where all content
  is dynamically rendered by React into the #root div element.
